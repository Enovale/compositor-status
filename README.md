# compositor-status
 A applet for KDE that displays whether or not the Compositor is enabled in the Tray Icon.

# Bugs
- Currently the compositor will sometimes toggle on/off if when you press the Settings or Quit applet in the task manager

# Help Wanted
 This code can definitely be improved by someone who knows Qt a bit better than I do. Feel free to shoot me a Pull Request for new features, fixes, or rewrites.
